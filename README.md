# What is Internet?
**INTERNET** is a short **form** of Interconnected Network of all the Web Servers Worldwide. It is also called the World Wide Web or simply the Web.

# How does the Internet Work?
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. The Internet works through a packet routing network in accordance with the  _Internet Protocol (IP)_, the  _Transport Control Protocol_  (TCP) and other protocols.

# Whats is Networking?

A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources,exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

## What is OSI Reference Model?

OSI means **Open System Interconnection**. It is a **reference model** that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer. This model is developed by [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (ISO) in 1984, and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications.
##  Functions of the OSI Layers
There are the seven OSI layers. Each layer has different functions.

**1.  Physical Layer
2.  Data-Link Layer
3.  Network Layer
4.  Transport Layer
5.  Session Layer
6.  Presentation Layer
7.  Application Layer**

## What is TCP/IP?
In simple word, TCP/IP is a set of rules that governs the connection of computer systems to the Internet. Sometimes TCP/IP is referred to as the backbone of the Internet.
TCP/IP has five layers or sometimes reffered four layers.TCP/IP was developed in the 1970s and adopted as the [protocol](https://www.britannica.com/technology/protocol-computer-science) standard for [ARPANET](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET) (the predecessor to the Internet) in 1983.

### TCP /IP Protocols
![protocols](https://i.ibb.co/6r6yXtd/protocols.png)

### Why called 'TCP/IP?
The name “TCP/IP” refers to an entire suite of data communications protocols. The suite gets its name from two of the protocols that belong to it: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP/IP is the traditional name for this protocol suite and it is the name used in this book. The TCP/IP protocol suite is also called the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS). Both names are acceptable.

## What is Private Network?
A **private network** is any connection within a specified **network** wherein restrictions are established to promote a secured environment. This type of **network** can be configured in such a way that devices outside the **network** cannot access it.
## What is Logical address?

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.

## What is Physical address?
A **physical address** is the hardware-level **address** used by the Ethernet interface to communicate on the **network**. Every device must have a unique **physical address**. This is often referred to as its **MAC** (Media Access Control) **address**.

# What is IP Address?
An IP address (_internet protocol address_) is a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network.There are two versions of IP that currently coexist in the global Internet: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). IP addresses are made up of binary values and drive the routing of all data over the Internet. **IPv4** addresses are **32 bits** long, and **IPv6** addresses **128 bits long.**

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

### IPv4
IPv4 was the first version of IP. It was deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. Today it is most widely used IP version. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.

The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. Till date, it is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.

### IPV6
IP version 6 is the new version of Internet Protocol, which is way better than IP version 4 in terms of complexity and efficiency.

## What is Network Interface?

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a **network interface** is a software or hardware [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing) "Interface (computing)") between two pieces of equipment or [protocol layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_layer "Protocol layer") in a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)
A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.


## What is Hop (in networking)?


Hop is the logical distance between networks based on the number of routers that must be traversed by packets sent between them.

## What is Ping?


Ping stands for **Packet Internet Gopher**. It's a network troubleshooting Tool.
The **Ping** tool is **used** to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. A **Ping** measures the time it takes for packets to be sent from the local host to a destination computer and back. The **Ping** tool measures and records the round-trip time of the packet and any losses along the way.

## What is network latency?
Latency is a measure of delay. In a network, latency measures the time it takes for some data to get to its destination across the network. It is usually measured as a round trip delay - the time taken for information to get to its destination and back again.
## Measuring latency
Latency is always expressed in  **milliseconds**  (ms).
Latency can either be measured as the  **Round Trip Time (RTT)**  or the  **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**:

-   **RTT**  is defined as the amount of time it takes a packet to get from the client to the server and back.
-   **TTFB**  is the amount of time it takes for the server to receive the first byte of data when the client sends a request.

# What is a Router?
A router is hardware device designed to receive, analyze and move incoming packets to another network. It may also be used to convert the packets to another network interface, drop them, and perform other actions relating to a network.

## What is Routing Table?
**Routing table:** Routers try to determine the most direct route that is also the most trustworthy route. The router checks a lookup table, called a routing table, which stores routes for data to travel. The router gets most of its intelligence from routing tables. 
**Routing tables contain information about the following:**
• Paths (routes) to particular networks
• How to handle special kinds of traffic
• Priorities for certain connections
## Why Router is called L3 Device?
A **router** is considered a **layer**-**3 device** because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the **layer**-**3** IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. ... For pure IP forwarding, a **router** is designed to minimize the state information associated with individual packets.
## Difference between Virtual router and Physical router

## What is Switch?
Switch is a Local Area Network Device. Use for connect two or more nodes in the same network. Ex: Pc, Printers.Works on Layer 2. Swiitch has one broadcast domain. Unless Vlan implemented.Switch Use MAC Address.Fowward Data as Frame.Switches use content accessible memory CAM table.

![switch](https://i.ibb.co/6mWxp6q/clipart1438997.png)

## Why Switch is Called L2 Device?
**Ethernet Switch**: Delivers Ethernet packets based on their destination MAC addresses, and has only one type of port, Ethernet. Commonly known as L2 device (L2 = Ethernet).

## What is L3 Switch?
-   **L3 Switch**: Performs (1) IP forwarding (delivering packets based on destination IP address) or (2) Ethernet switching (delivering based on destination MAC address) according to the destination MAC address of a received packet. It has only one type of port, Ethernet. Commonly known as L2/L3 device or multi-layer switch (L2 = Ethernet, L3 = IP).
-   To simply put it, an L3 switch is a combination of an Ethernet switch and IP router.
## What is DHCP?
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that provides quick, automatic, and central management for the distribution of IP addresseswithin a network. DHCP is also used to configure the subnet, default gateway, and DNS Server information on the device.
### Diagram 
![dhcp](https://i.ibb.co/9G6PVy9/csg66-01-how-dhcp-works.png)

## How Does DHCP Work ?

DHCP works by leasing IP addresses and IP information to network clients for a period of time. For the lease to happen, the following negotiation process occurs:

**1.**  During the boot process, a client computer that is configured as a DHCP client sends out a broadcast packet called DHCPDISCOVER. This Discover packet contains the client’s computer name and Media Access Control (MAC) address so the DHCP servers can respond to it. Basically, the Discover packet says, “I’m looking for a DHCP server who can lease an IP address.”

**2.**  DHCP servers on the network respond to the broadcast with a DHCPOFFER. In essence, the DHCPOFFER says, “I am a DHCP server and I have a lease for you.” If several DHCP servers respond to the request, the client accepts the first offer that it receives.

**3.**  The client responds via a broadcast message called a DHCPREQUEST. This message basically says, “I accept your lease offer and would like an IP address.” If other DHCP servers made offers, they also see their lease offers were not accepted by the broadcast message, so they rescind their offers. (They must not like getting snubbed by a client computer.)

**4.**  The DHCP server whose offer was accepted responds with a DHCPACK message, which acknowledges the lease acceptance and contains the client’s IP address lease as well as other IP addressing information that you configure the server to provide. The client is now a TCP/IP client and can participate on the network.

## What is DNS?
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).

### Types of DNS Service

**Authoritative DNS:** An  **authoritative DNS**  service provides an update mechanism that developers use to manage their public DNS names. It then answers DNS queries, translating domain names into IP address so computers can communicate with each other. Authoritative DNS has the final authority over a domain and is responsible for providing answers to  **recursive DNS**  servers with the IP address information.  **Amazon Route 53 is an authoritative DNS system.**

**Recursive DNS**: Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services. Instead, they generally connect to another type of DNS service known a  **resolver**, or a **recursive DNS**  service. A recursive DNS service acts like a hotel concierge: while it doesn't own any DNS records, it acts as an intermediary who can get the DNS information on your behalf. If a recursive DNS has the DNS reference  **cached**, or stored for a period of time, then it answers the DNS query by providing the source or IP information. If not, it passes the query to one or more authoritative DNS servers to find the information.

## What is CIDR?
CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is an IP addressing scheme that improves the allocation of IP addresses. It replaces the old system based on classes A, B, and C. This scheme also helped greatly **extend the life of IPv4** as well as slow the growth of routing tables.
